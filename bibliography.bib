Previous protocols for this task required a security deposit that is O(N2) times larger than the bet amount, where N is the number of players. Our protocols are based on a tournament bracket construction, and require only O(logN) rounds. Our lottery protocols thus represent a significant improvement, both because they allow players with little money to participate, and because of the time value of money. The Ethereum-based implementation of our lottery is highly efficient. The Bitcoin implementation requires an O(2N) off-chain setup phase, which demonstrates that the expressive power of the scripting language can have important implications. We also describe a minimal modification to the Bitcoin protocol that would eliminate the exponential blowup. © 2017 IEEE.},

As a result, the protocol is scalable, provides efficient verification of the random process and does not rely on a trusted third party nor on assumptions of bounded computational resources.

We then show how the Bitcoin network can be used to achieve the above notion of fairness in the two-party as well as the multiparty setting (with a dishonest majority). In particular, we propose new ideal functionalities and protocols for fair secure computation and fair lottery in this model. One of our main contributions is the definition of an ideal primitive, which we call F*CR (CR stands for "claim-or-refund"), that formalizes and abstracts the exact properties we require from the Bitcoin network to achieve our goals. Naturally, this abstraction allows us to design fair protocols in a hybrid model in which parties have access to the F*CR functionality, and is otherwise independent of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We also show an efficient realization of F*CR that requires only two Bitcoin transactions to be made on the network. Our constructions also enjoy high efficiency. In a multiparty setting, our protocols only require a constant number of calls to F*CR per party on top of a standard multiparty secure computation protocol. Our fair multiparty lottery protocol improves over previous solutions which required a quadratic number of Bitcoin transactions. © 2014 International Association for Cryptologic Research.},

@inproceedings{andrychowicz_secure_2014,
	title = {Secure multiparty computations on bitcoin},
	doi = {10.1109/SP.2014.35},
	abstract = {Bit coin is a decentralized digital currency, introduced in 2008, that has recently gained noticeable popularity. Its main features are: (a) it lacks a central authority that controls the transactions, (b) the list of transactions is publicly available, and (c) its syntax allows more advanced transactions than simply transferring the money. The goal of this paper is to show how these properties of Bit coin can be used in the area of secure multiparty computation protocols (MPCs). Firstly, we show that the Bit coin system provides an attractive way to construct a version of "timed commitments", where the committer has to reveal his secret within a certain time frame, or to pay a fine. This, in turn, can be used to obtain fairness in some multiparty protocols. Secondly, we introduce a concept of multiparty protocols that work "directly on Bit coin". Recall that the standard definition of the MPCs guarantees only that the protocol "emulates the trusted third party". Hence ensuring that the inputs are correct, and the outcome is respected is beyond the scope of the definition. Our observation is that the Bit coin system can be used to go beyond the standard "emulation-based" definition, by constructing protocols that link their inputs and the outputs with the real Bit coin transactions. As an instantiation of this idea we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bit coin currency, without relying on a trusted authority (one of these protocols uses the Bit coin-based timed commitments mentioned above). Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example: if one party interrupts the protocol then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it we performed their transactions in the actual Bit coin system), and can be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites. We think that this paradigm can have also other applications. We discuss some of them. © 2014 IEEE.},

In the literature, a number of e-lottery schemes have been introduced over the last two decades. However, most of these schemes rely on some computational assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a novel e-lottery scheme that achieves information theoretical security. Our proposed scheme is designed using symmetric bivariate polynomials, and it satisfies the required security properties, such as correctness, unpredictability, verifiability, and robustness. Moreover, the winning number is generated in a distributed fashion, so that no trusted third party needs to be involved and the danger of a single point of failure is minimized. © 2019 by the authors.},

They allow to perform computation with encrypted data without the knowledge of any secret information. In many applications, the ability to perform decryption, i.e. the knowledge of the secret key, gives a huge power. A classical way to reduce the trust in such a secret owner, and consequently to increase the security, is to share the secret between many entities in such a way that cooperation between them is necessary to decrypt. In this paper, we propose a distributed version of the Paillier cryptosystem presented at Eurocrypt’99.

	doi = {10.1007/BFb0055485},
	abstract = {This paper uses delaying functions, functions that require significant calculation time, in the development of a one-pass lottery scheme in which winners are chosen fairly using only internal information. Since all this information may be published (even before the lottery closes), anyone can do the calculation and therefore verify that the winner was chosen correctly. Since the calculation uses a delaying function, ticket purchasers cannot take advantage of this information. Fraud on the part of the lottery agent is detectable and no single ticket purchaser needs to be trusted.

For one application, two versions of a lottery scheme are presented in which the result of the lottery is determined by the ticket numbers purchased, but no one can control the outcome or determine what it is until after the lottery closes. This is because the outcome is kept secret in a way that is breakable after a predictable amount of time and/or computation.

A natural question is whether it is possible to generate these tosses uniformly at random within the network. The subject of this paper is a constructible, provably-secure, fully-polynomial approximation scheme to obtain such coin tosses. In other words, if the bias of the coin is allowed to be e, the length of the messages required by this scheme is polynomial in n and l/e, and it can be shown that breaking the cryptographic devices used by this scheme is equivalent to solving a well-known hard number theoretic problem. Previous algorithms for such distributed coin tosses were provably secure and constructible, but exponential in the size the network (Yao, Awerbuch \& al.), provably secure and and polynomial, but not constructible (Yao), and polynomial, constructible, but not provably secure in the above sense (Broder \& Dolev). © 1985 ACM.},

	abstract = {Transactions using the Bitcoin system, which is built atop a novel blockchain technology where miners run distributed consensus to ensure the security, will cause relatively high transaction costs to incentivize miners to behave honestly. Besides, a transaction should wait a quite long time (about 10 min on average) before being confirmed on the blockchain, which makes micropayments not cost-effective. In CCS’15, Pass and shelat proposed three novel micropayment schemes for any ledger-based transaction system, using the idea of probabilistic payments suggested by Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997), which are called as the “Lottery-based Micropayments”. However, the one among the three schemes, which is fully compatible with the current Bitcoin system and only requires an “invisible” verifiable third party, needs two on-chain transactions during each execution, even if both the user and the merchant are honest. To reduce the transaction costs and increase efficiency, this paper proposes a fast lottery-based micropayment scheme to improve their work. By setting up a time-locked deposit, whose secure utilization is assured by the security of a primitive called accountable assertions under the discrete logarithm assumption, our scheme reduces the number of on-chain transactions to one, and yet maintains the original scheme’s advantages. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

Or can one construct a fully decentralized protocol for selling secret information, so that neither the seller nor the buyer can cheat in it? Until recently, it seemed that every online protocol that has financial consequences for the participants needs to rely on some sort of a trusted server that ensures that the money is transferred between them. In this work, we propose to use Bitcoin (a digital currency, introduced in 2008) to design such fully decentralized protocols that are secure even if no trusted third party is available. As an instantiation of this idea, we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bitcoin currency, without relying on a trusted authority. Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example, if one party interrupts the protocol, then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it, we performed their transactions in the actual Bitcoin system) and in principle could be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites. © Copyright 2016 by Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

The winning candidate is determined by majority voting, while the privacy of individual vote is preserved. Moreover, the decision is irrevocable in the sense that once the outcome is revealed, the winning candidate is guaranteed to have the funding from all n voters. As in previous works, each voter is incentivized to follow the protocol by being required to put a deposit in the system, which will be used as compensation if he deviates from the protocol. Our solution is similar to previous protocols used for lottery, but needs an additional phase to distribute secret random numbers via zero-knowledge-proofs. Moreover, we have resolved a security issue in previous protocols that could prevent compensation from being paid. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Back and Bentov (arXiv 2014) and Andrychowicz et al. (Security and Privacy 2014) introduced techniques to perform secure multiparty computations on Bitcoin. Among other things, these works constructed lottery protocols that ensure that any party that aborts after learning the outcome pays a monetary penalty to all other parties. Following this, Andrychowicz et al. (BitcoinWorkshop 2014) and concurrently Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014) extended the solution to arbitrary secure function evaluation while guaranteeing fairness in the following sense: any party that aborts after learning the output pays a monetary penalty to all parties that did not learn the output. Andrychowicz et al. (BitcoinWorkshop 2014) also suggested extending to scenarios where parties receive a payoff according to the output of a secure function evaluation, and outlined a 2-party protocol for the same that in addition satisfies the notion of fairness described above. In this work, we formalize, generalize, and construct multiparty protocols for the primitive suggested by Andrychowicz et al. We call this primitive secure cash distribution with penalties. Our formulation of secure cash distribution with penalties poses it as a multistage reactive functionality (i.e., more general than secure function evaluation) that provides a way to securely implement smart contracts in a decentralized setting, and consequently suffices to capture a wide variety of stateful computations involving data and/or money, such as decentralized auctions, markets, and games such as poker, etc. Our protocol realizing secure cash distribution with penalties works in a hybrid model where parties have access to a claim-or-refund transaction functionality F∗ CR which can be efficiently realized in (a variant of) Bitcoin, and is otherwise independent of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We emphasize that our protocol is dropout-tolerant in the sense that any party that drops out during the protocol is forced to pay a monetary penalty to all other parties. Our formalization and construction generalize both secure computation with penalties of Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014), and secure lottery with penalties of Andrychowicz et al.

One possible application of such protocols is the fair contract signing: each party is forced to complete the protocol, or to pay to the other one a fine.
We also show how to link the output of this protocol to the Bitcoin currency. More precisely: we show a method to design secure two-party protocols for functionalities that result in a “forced” financial transfer from one party to the other.
Our protocols build upon the ideas of our recent paper “Secure Multiparty Computations on Bitcoin” (Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2013/784). Compared to that paper, our results are more general, since our protocols allow to compute any function, while in the previous paper we concentrated only on some specific tasks (commitment schemes and lotteries).

Electronic lotteries are, in fact, extremely high risk financial application: If one discovers a way to predict or otherwise claim the winning numbers (even once) the result is huge financial damages. Moreover, the e-lottery process is complex, which increases the possibility of fraud or costly accidental failures. In addition, a national lottery must adhere to auditability and (regulatory) fairness requirements regarding its drawings. Our mechanism, which we believe is the first one of its kind to be described in the literature, builds upon a number of cryptographic primitives that ensure the unpredictability of the winning numbers, the prevention of their premature leakages and prevention of fraud. We also provide measures for auditability, fairness, and trustworthiness of the process. Besides cryptography, we incorporate security mechanisms that eliminate various risks along the entire process.

	abstract = {Based on our experience in designing, building and maintaining an information system for supporting a large scale electronic lottery, we present in this paper a unified approach to the design and implementation of electronic lotteries with the focus on pragmatic trust establishment. This approach follows closely the methodologies commonly employed in the development of general information systems. However, central to the proposed approach is the decomposition of a security critical system into layers containing basic trust components so as to facilitate the management of trust, first along the layers, and then as we move from layer to layer. We believe that such a structured approach, based on layers and trust components, can help designers of security critical applications produce demonstrably robust and verifiable systems that people will not hesitate to use. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Our motivation is the notion of ``timed-release crypto,'''' where the goal is to encrypt a message so that it can not be decrypted by anyone, not even the sender, until a pre-determined amount of time has passed. The goal is to ``send information into the future.'''' This problem was first discussed by Timothy May {\textbackslash}cite\{May93\}. What are the applications of ``timed-release crypto''''? Here are a few possibilities (some due to May): A bidder in an auction wants to seal his bid so that it can only be opened after the bidding period is closed. A homeowner wants to give his mortgage holder a series of encrypted mortgage payments. These might be encrypted digital cash with different decryption dates, so that one payment becomes decryptable (and thus usable by the bank) at the beginning of each successive month. An individual wants to encrypt his diaries so that they are only decryptable after fifty years. A key-escrow scheme can be based on timed-release crypto, so that the government can get the message keys, but only after a fixed period (say one year). {\textbackslash} There are presumably many other applications. There are two natural approaches to implementing timed-release crypto: Use ``time-lock puzzles''''--computational problems that can not be solved without running a computer continuously for at least a certain amount of time. Use trusted agents who promise not to reveal certain information until a specified date. Using trusted agents has the obvious problem of ensuring that the agents are trustworthy; secret-sharing approaches can be used to alleviate this concern. Using time-lock puzzles has the problem that the CPU time required to solve a problem can depend on the amount and nature of the hardware used to solve the problem, as well as the parallelizability of the computational problem being solved. In this note we explore both approaches. (We note that Tim May has suggested an approach based on the use of trusted agents.)},

Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.},

	abstract = {In today's programmable blockchains, smart contracts are limited to being deterministic and non-probabilistic. This lack of randomness is a consequential limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result, several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the owner of the oracle or the miners. We propose a novel game-theoretic approach for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain. Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles, hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general class of probabilistic programs.},

As a side-effect of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work-based consensus system, random values are broadcast every time new blocks are mined. We can derive strong lower bounds on the computational min-entropy in each block: currently, at least 68 bits of min-entropy are produced every 10 minutes, from which one can derive over 32 nearuniform bits using standard extractor techniques. We show that any attack on this beacon would form an attack on Bitcoin itself and hence have a monetary cost that we can bound, unlike any other construction for a public randomness beacon in the literature. In our simplest construction, we show that a lottery producing a single unbiased bit is manipulation-resistant against an attacker with a stake of less than 50 bitcoins in the output, or about US\$12,000 today.

	abstract = {Smart contracts combine protocols with user interfaces to formalize and secure relationships over computer networks. Objectives and principles for the design of these systems are derived from legal principles, economic theory, and theories of reliable and secure protocols. Similarities and differences between smart contracts and traditional business procedures based on written contracts, controls, and static forms are discussed. By using cryptographic and other security mechanisms, we can secure many algorithmically specifiable relationships from breach by principals, and from eavesdropping or malicious interference by third parties, up to considerations of time, user interface, and completeness of the algorithmic specification. This article discusses protocols with application in important contracting areas, including credit, content rights management, payment systems, and contracts with bearer.},

	abstract = {A Bitcoin wallet is a set of private keys known to a user and which allow that user to spend any Bitcoin associated with those keys. In a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, child private keys are generated pseudorandomly from a master private key, and the corresponding child public keys can be generated by anyone with knowledge of the master public key. These wallets have several interesting applications including Internet retail, trustless audit, and a treasurer allocating funds among departments. A specification of HD wallets has even been accepted as Bitcoin standard BIP32.Unfortunately, in all existing HD wallets—including BIP32 wallets—an attacker can easily recover the master private key given the master public key and any child private key. This vulnerability precludes use cases such as a combined treasurer-auditor, and some in the Bitcoin community have suspected that this vulnerability cannot be avoided.We propose a new HD wallet that is not subject to this vulnerability. Our HD wallet can tolerate the leakage of up to m private keys with a master public key size of O(m). We prove that breaking our HD wallet is at least as hard as the so-called “one more” discrete logarithm problem.},

	abstract = {Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptions on the “hashing power” of the adversary relative to network synchronicity; we show our results to be tight under high synchronization.Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built “on top” of the backbone protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto’s suggestion falls short of solving it, and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary’s hashing power is bounded by 1/31/31/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin’s operation as a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and that the adversary’s hashing power is strictly less than 1/21/21/2, while the adversarial bound needed for security decreases as the network desynchronizes.},

	abstract = {A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records, or public ledger of all transactions or digital events
that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified
by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. Once entered, information can never be erased. The
blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital
currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and
found wide range of applications in both financial and non-financial world.
The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital
online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an
irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology, and the revolution
in this space has just begun.
This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both financial and
non-financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world.},
