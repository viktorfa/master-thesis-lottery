\chapter*{Preface}
%Here, you give a brief introduction to your work. What it is (e.g., a Master's thesis in AIMT at NTNU, when it was carried out (e.g., during the autumn semester of 2021). If the project has been carried out with a company, you should mention this and also describe the cooperation with the company. You may also describe how the idea to the project was brought up.

%You should also specify the assumed background of the readers of this report (who are you writing for).\\[2cm]

This is a Master's thesis carried out during the spring semester of 2019 for the completion of the 5-year computer science program at \NTNU, Trondheim.
The idea for a tournament based lottery on Ethereum was inspired by the works of Miller and Bentov and Bartoletti and Zunino. The search for a thesis went over a long time during which I studied blockchain applications and learned about blockchain.

The readers of this report are assumed to have a background in computer science with some knowledge of distributed systems and blockchains.
