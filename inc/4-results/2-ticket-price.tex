\section{Ticket price}
\label{sec:ticket-price}

We operate with a gas price of 1.5 gwei, which at the time of writing is considered quite low, but still enough to make the transaction be included in about 30 minutes or so. 

Most common casino games have a house edge of about 1-10\%~\cite{walsh_houses_nodate}, while large lotteries often have a higher house edge of 40-50\%~\cite{shackleford_house_nodate}. We therefore consider the organizer taking a 10\% fee of the prize reasonable for both the players and the organizer. The organizer risks not enough players joining the lottery and thus losing all the ether needed to set up the lottery. For simplicity, we will in subsequent calculations assume that the organizer takes a fee so large that it exactly covers the gas costs of setting up the lottery.

By setting a ratio $r$ of what the organizer will take of the prize, and a gas price $price_{gas}$, we can find a minimum ticket price $price_{ticket}$ by using the gas usage $usage_{gas}$ from Table \ref{tab:org-gas-usage-dual} for setting up the lottery per player. The expression is simply $price_{ticket}=\frac{price_{gas} \cdot usage_{gas}}{r}$. If the ticket price is lower than this, the ratio $r$ of the prize is not large enough to cover the organizer's gas costs. 
In our design, a 10\% organizer fee and a 1.5 gwei gas price, this results in a minimum viable price of each ticket at about 0.026 ether, which at the time of writing is about 5 USD. That's a price we consider acceptable, even though the dollar price can change by at least an order of magnitude within months, as the ether price fluctuates a lot.
