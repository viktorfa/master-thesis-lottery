\section{Ticket price}
\label{sec:ticket-price}

For the second design on average, a player spends 82616 gas to join, and for each level, assuming they commit and reveal, 120157 gas. At level $l$ of the tournament tree, if we index levels from 0 from the root, the probability of winning is $\frac{1}{2^{l+1}}$. If we assume the prize is 100\% of the deposits, the prize will be $price \cdot N=price \cdot 2^L$. The first lottery level is $L-1$. For it to be worth playing the first match, the price must be so high that $prize \cdot \frac{1}{2^L} > cost_{tx}(L-1)$ or $2^L \cdot price \cdot \frac{1}{2^L} > cost_{tx}(L-1)$. The inequality simply solves as $price > cost_{tx}(L-1)$, which means that if the gas price is 1.5 gwei and L=10, the ticket cost must be at least $120157 * 10 \cdot 1.5 \mathrm{e}{-9}=0.0018 eth$ or 0.32 USD. 
This means that the cost of initializing the lottery, which is paid by the lottery organizer, is by far the most significant cost. If we use off-chain negotiation in the matches, the transaction cost will approximately be cut in half, as we only need one transaction from the winner for each match. When calculating a minimum viable price for participating in the lottery, we should therefore primarily consider the price to set up the lottery for the organizer and how much of the ticket income the organizer takes as a fee.
