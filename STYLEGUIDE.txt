This is Viktor's personal styleguide. The goal is not to override NTNU's styleguide. But to make it easy to have a consistent style, grammer, and spelling for what the default NTNU styleguide does not cover.


SPELLING
- Use US English spelling. 
- Use "joined" words where is it acceptable, as opposed to split words or hyphenated words. E.g. lifecycle is preferred over life cycle or life-cycle. A dictionary is the preferred authority to decide what is acceptable, but many domain-specific words are not in a dictionary, so we must use Wikipedia or other computer science literature.
- Use hyphenation rather than split words where acceptable. E.g. so-called over so called.

GRAMMAR
- Commas around however etc. Not decided yet.
- Use long hyphens '–' as a sentence break, not short hyphens '-'.
- Long hyphens, commas, dots, semi-colons, and colons can all be used where appropriate.
- Avoid shortening two words into one word with an apostrophe. E.g. use cannot, do not, and she is rather than can't don't and she's.
- Use comma before the last item (Oxford comma) when listing things. E.g. Alice, Bob, and Carol.
- Don't use gendered pronouns, just use they, them, themselves, etc. Don't use she or he or her or his.
- Try to avoid using parentheses.


STYLE
- Use dots '.' and not commas ',' in decimal numbers, just like in a programming language. Both in math expressions and outside math expressions.
- Use math expressions for letter variables, even if they stand alone, but not for numbers. E.g. $N$ participants, but not $16$ participants. If the variables are used in a name, such as the M of N signatures scheme, then don't use math expressions when referring to that scheme.
- Only use \texttt{} when referring to code. Don't use \texttt{} when referring to variables or math expressions where $ $ should be used.
- Use \emph{} when introducing new words. Don't use \textbf{} as bold text is reserved for headers
- Always have parenthesis after a function when both in math mode and \texttt{} mode. Even when you don't specify the parameters or arguments. E.g. $Hash()$ is a hash function
- Use full words when describing functions in math mode. E.g. $Sign(SK, M)$ is preferred over $S(SK, M)$.
- Use full words for variables that are not very common. E.g. use $salt$ rather than $s$. But letters can be used in very common variables such as $H:=Hash(C)$
- Use $:=$ as the assignment operator. $=$ is the equality operator.
- End all captions with a period '.'
- Don't end headers with a period.
- I'm using a few footnotes now, even though I don't really like it. I'm also not sure if NTNU likes them.
- Prefix each reference with the full capitalized word of the reference type. E.g. Chapter \ref{chap:background} and Figure \ref{fig:bitcoin-transactions}. When listing references, only use one non-pluralized capitalized word. E.g. Table \ref{tab:gas-usage} and \ref{tab:org-gas-usage-single}.


MISC
- Try to not use 'we' and 'us' or certainly not 'I'. 
...
- Don't use smileys
- Don't use tildes '~' to make cute speech. E.g. Okay ~~
